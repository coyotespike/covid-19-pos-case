The origin of these files is unknown. They were hosted in the Arterys Marketplace's Google Drive.

As of 26 March 2020, type of image (CT vs x-ray) also unknown. Assume they should be DICOM files.

I have briefly checked whether they are duplicates of AHP files, looking at the file names only.

Investigation needed.
